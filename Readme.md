*I swear the look of the LCK/LEC Observer HUD looks dope af*

## About
This is a project to make my own Observer HUD for League of Legends, serving for any future tournaments hosted by [my Esports club](https://www.facebook.com/hcmusec), using the [LoL Production Toolkit](https://github.com/RCVolus/lol-prod-toolkit) for real-time in-game data.

**Note**: This is far from a great design, I'm just doing this for fun. Contributions and Pull Requests are welcome.

## Installation
*coming soon*
